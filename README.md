# Lorenz System Visualizer

This is an modified interactive visualizer of [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system). 

This project is based on [skeeto/lorenz-webgl](https://github.com/skeeto/lorenz-webgl), thanks to the author for the great work.

I fixed some problems and add some features to the original project:

- Improved the control panel and made it eazier to:
  - Modify the parameters of the lorenz system.
  - Modify the display-related parameters.
  - Manage the solutions/samples.
- Add some functions:
  - Toggle Axes.
  - Project on X-Y, Y-Z, X-Z plane.
  - More presets under different parameters to reveal the evolution of lorenz system. 
- Fixed some problems:
  - Wrong binding of the param 'rho'.
